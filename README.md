# Golang Init Codebase Overview

This codebase is a collection of small Go (GoLang) projects, each in its own folder, demonstrating fundamental Go programming concepts. Each numbered directory contains a self-contained Go module with example code. Below is a summary of what each folder covers:

- **01hello**: Basic "Hello, World!" program.
- **02variables**: Variable declarations, types, constants, and printing variable types.
- **03userinput**: Reading user input from the console.
- **04conversion**: String to number conversion and error handling.
- **05mymath**: Using the `math/rand` package for random numbers.
- **06mytime**: Working with dates and times using the `time` package.
- **07pointers**: Introduction to pointers and memory addresses.
- **08array**: Working with arrays.
- **09myslices**: Working with slices, appending, slicing, and sorting.
- **10gomaps**: Using maps (dictionaries), adding, deleting, and iterating.
- **11mystructs**: Defining and using structs.
- **12ifelse**: If-else statements and variable scoping.
- **13switchcase**: Switch-case statements and the `fallthrough` keyword.
- **14myloops**: For loops, range loops, and `goto` statements.
- **15functions**: Defining functions, variadic functions, and multiple return values.
- **16methods**: Methods on structs, value receivers, and method behavior.
- **17defer**: The `defer` statement and its execution order.
- **18files**: File creation, writing, reading, and error handling.
- **19webrequests**: Making HTTP GET requests and reading responses.
- **20urls**: Parsing URLs and extracting components.

Each project is designed to be run independently and focuses on a specific Go language feature or standard library package. This structure is ideal for learning Go step by step, with practical examples for each concept.
